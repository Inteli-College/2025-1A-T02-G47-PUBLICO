**Student:** Abner Silva Barbosa  

**Track: Entrepreneurship | Module 1 ‚Äî 2025**

---

## Introduction

This report presents a detailed summary of the activities developed throughout the first module in the Entrepreneurship track. Our goal was to initiate the development of an innovative solution that uses advanced Artificial Intelligence to translate clinical and pharmaceutical technical documents, maintaining specialized terminology, original formatting, and precision necessary for the regulatory and research context. The solution aims not only to translate text but to preserve complex elements such as tables, graphs, and images with captions, ensuring the integrity of technical documents.

## Project Overview

### Identified Problem

We identified a significant gap in the market for translation of technical documents in the pharmaceutical and clinical research area. Currently, organizations face three critical challenges:

1. **Errors in manual translations**: Translators without specialized knowledge often compromise the integrity of technical information, potentially leading to incorrect interpretations that negatively impact research and regulatory processes.
2. **Delays in the translation process**: Critical documents (ranging from 15 to 300 pages) can take weeks to be translated manually, causing significant delays in regulatory and operational deadlines.
3. **Confidentiality risk**: Sending sensitive documents to external translators or services without adequate protection compromises the security of patient data and intellectual property.

### Proposed Solution

Our solution integrates cutting-edge technologies to create a comprehensive specialized translation platform:

- **Specialized AI system**: We developed an artificial intelligence model specifically trained for medical and pharmaceutical terminology, capable of maintaining technical precision.
- **Intelligent document processing**: We implemented advanced PDF and DOC handling that preserves the original formatting, including tables, graphs, and images with captions.
- **Collaborative interface**: We created an intuitive platform that allows real-time review, editing, and feedback, accelerating the translation cycle and continuous improvement of the model.
- **Security and compliance**: We implemented robust security protocols, encryption, and compliance with regulatory standards (LGPD/GDPR) to ensure data confidentiality.
